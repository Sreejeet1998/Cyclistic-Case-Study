# Cyclistic-Case-Study

This project is a case study for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company. The goal of the analysis is to provide insights into how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, and to suggest strategies for converting casual riders into annual members.
Features

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into rider behavior, trip durations, times, and locations.
    Visualizations: Includes a variety of plots and charts to illustrate differences between casual riders and annual members.
    Recommendations: Based on the analysis, suggests strategies for increasing membership and improving overall user experience.
